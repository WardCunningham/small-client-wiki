# small-client-wiki
We explore a read-only client written in react.

We will share only json schema with current fedwiki. 
We will write conventional react code and give up if we can't make that work.
We will build this into a single js file that includes all available plugins also rewritten in react.

# build

tbd

# deploy

We hope to render wiki json served from gh-pages.
We don't know how many limitations we will face but hope to find configurations that are useful.
Some concerns we know about.
- gh-pages must be https, unless accessed as some other domain.
- gh-pages don't support cors so javascript must come from gh-pages too.

We expect there will be many deployment options with different tradeoffs.

# contribute

We're happy to have issues or pull-requests.

- collaborators can be pushed to mater if pair-programming and reviewed before post.
- collaborators working solo should push to a branch and pull-request for a reviewe and merge.
- contributors should fork and pull-request from their own repo.
